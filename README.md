Passenger class:

-Most passengers are from 3rd class

-A majority of first-class passengers survived, and most people in 3rd class died

-It seems that survival is strongly correlated with the passenger class

-Women in 1st and 2nd class had more chance to survive. For men, 2nd class was almost as bad as 3rd class
