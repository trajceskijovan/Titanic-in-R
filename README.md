# Passenger class:
1. Most passengers are from 3rd class
2. A majority of first-class passengers survived, and most people in 3rd class died
3. It seems that survival is strongly correlated with the passenger class
4. Women in 1st and 2nd class had more chance to survive. For men, 2nd class was almost as bad as 3rd class
